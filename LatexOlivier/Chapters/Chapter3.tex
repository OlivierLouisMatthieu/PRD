\section{Introduction}

In this chapter, the opening mode failure behaviour is investigated using the DIC method. We present and analyse the force vs the crack opening curve obtained with the DIC method and python code.  Then the evolution of the crack length curves along the x-axis is obtained as a function of displacement. Finally, the energy restitution rates for the MMCG specimens are calculated and analysed with some other articles.

\section{Experimental set-up and method}

The Landmark Servohydraulic compression tensile machine, with a capacity of 100 kN, can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:Setup0°}. The camera and Arcan device are also clearly visible. The part of the specimen with the speckle pattern was illuminated so that the black dots could be correctly distinguished for image correlation. The camera was mounted on a tripod in order to capture stable images during the tests. The movable jaw of the test machine is controlled in fixtures. It is equipped with a force sensor.
The information combined with the COD obtained by the DIC method gives the force-crack opening curves for each test.

\end{figure}

The kinematic fields acquired by image correlation (e.g., subset size, subset step, ldots) and numerical differentiation (e.g., strain windows size) algorithms can be significantly impacted by the DIC configuration settings. Since they will determine the spatial resolution and accuracy linked to the DIC measurements, both in displacement and strain fields, these settings constitute fundamental parameters.  In order to balance resolution and spatial resolution, a parametric research was done to support the DIC setting for the current application. The MatchID 2D Parametric Module was used to conduct this investigation.

\begin{table}[]

	\begin{tabular}{c c}
		\hline
		Correlation   Coefficient: & ZNSSD \\ 
		Interpolation order: & Bicubic Splines \\ 
		Transformation order: & Affine \\

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{MatchID parameters used}

\end{table}

The range of values defined in this performance study, including the subset size ($f_s$), subset step, affine and quadratic displacement shape functions, the size of the strain windows, and the order of the polynomial fitting function, is defined by the \ref{tab:MatchID_param}. It is believed that the pre-selected range of values is reflective of the permissible DIC setup parameter range.

\section{Force-displacement curve}

Normally four distinct parts are observed on a force-displacement curve:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A small area visible at the beginning of the curve which corresponds to the setting up of the loaded specimen. 
	\item A practically linear zone, terminated by the critical force FC , due to the elastic part of the loading with a static crack front.
	\item A third part characterised by the observation of a set of critical force peaks FC responsible for a fairly clear initiation of the crack. The increasing peaks validate the zone of stability of the crack.
	\item Finally, a last part where the rupture of the material occurs following the application of a breaking force translating the final instability of the crack.
\end{itemize}

 In the figure \ref{fig:e0e1_Pdelta}, we don't see the setting up of the loaded specimen because a slight preload has been applied to the specimen so that it does not move during the beginning of the test. In addition, it is also quite difficult to see the critical FC force peaks because of the noise caused by the displacement sensor.

\end{figure}


\section{Deformation maps}

Typical deformation map ($\epsilon$yy) obtained with the DIC method is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig38}.
During the tests we noticed that the cracks tend to propagate according to the orientation and inclination of the fibres.
In figure \ref{fig:fig38} for specimen e2e2, we assume a small fibre inclination which could explain the crack orientation that we see.

\begin{figure}[htp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=9cm]{fig38}
	\caption{Example of deformation map specimen e2e2 ($\epsilon$yy)}
	\label{fig:fig38}
\end{figure}

Strain maps are used to best locate the position of the the crack tip by graphic reading.
Thus, thanks to the deformation maps we are able to obtain the crack length on different stages. It is then possible to check whether method 1 is working correctly.
The blue points figure \ref{fig:fig39} and \ref{fig:fig40} for tests e2e2 and e4e1 are the points read graphically with the deformation maps. It can be seen that the blue points follow the curve of method 1 correctly, so we can consider that method 1 works and that we can use it for all the tests.

\section{Force - Crack opening curve}

The crack opening curves are presented in Figures x. It is obtained from the displacement maps and using the methodology presented in method 1.

Add some plots later

\section{Force-Crack length curve}

Figure x shows an example of the evolution of the force as a function of the crack length. The crack length increases gradually and continuously before rupture. It is the design of its shape that allows the stable propagation of the crack. Indeed, with this specimen, cracks progress slowly until failure occurs at maximum force.

\section{Discussion}

Table \ref{fig:fig37} compares the different values obtained in this study with literature values obtained on temperate species. These are numerous, especially in mode I. In order to provide an objective comparison, the discussion focuses on temperate species with the same density and an initial crack oriented in the RL direction.
