	Abstract = {A state-of-the-art infrared marker-tracking system that consists of eight cameras outfitted with infra-red optical filters and an array of infra-red light-emitting diodes as well as a set of reflective markers, is used to record the motion of a set of markers arranged along a trunk-dominated potted tree, which was pulled and released to perform free vibrations. The time-history diagrams of these markers are numerically fitted to the corresponding analytical mathematical model for each marker, in which the markers are treated as particles performing in-plane oscillations. This combination of experimental, analytical and numerical results yields the main vibration properties of the markers, i.e. the points on the tree: natural frequencies, damping ratios and the position of principal axes in two cases: for the in-leaf and out-of-leaf tree under consideration. The shape of the time history diagrams for the motion along one direction indicates the initial increase of the amplitude, and this property is found to be associated with two closed-valued natural frequencies. These two natural frequencies decreased after the removal of leaves, but stayed closed-valued. Two natural frequencies correspond to two principal axes, whose change along the height of the tree is also determined in both cases. The change of the damping ratios associated with two principal axes is also obtained: only one of them changed after the removal of leaves. Besides providing a proof of concept for the use of the high-tech marker-tracking system for obtaining certain oscillatory characteristics, this study also points out the possibilities for future work in which this system can be beneficial for investigating tree vibrations and deflections under different loads.},

abstract = { This work addresses the reconstruction of strain gradient fields at the wood growth ring scale from full-field deformation measurements provided by digital image correlation. Moreover, the spatial distribution of the earlywood and latewood radial modulus of elasticity is assessed. Meso-scale tensile tests are carried out on Pinus pinaster Ait. wooden specimens oriented in the radial–tangential plane under quasi-static loading conditions. A parametric analysis of the two-dimensional digital image correlation extrinsic and intrinsic setting parameters is performed, in a balance between spatial resolution and resolution. It is shown that the parametric module is an effective way to quantitatively support the choice of digital image correlation parameters in the presence of the high deformation gradient fields generated by the structure–property relationships at the scale of observation. Under the assumption of a uniaxial tensile stress state, the spatial distribution of the radial elastic modulus across the growth rings is obtained. It is observed that the ratio of the radial modulus of elasticity between latewood and earlywood tissues can vary significantly as a function of the digital image correlation parameters. It is pointed out, however, that a convergence value can be systematically established. Effectively, earlywood and latewood stress–strain curves are obtained and elastic properties are determined assuming the converged digital image correlation setting parameters. }

	Abstract				 = {This study investigated the influence of pressing temperature and moisture content on the mechanical properties of wood compressed in radial direction. Jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) specimens were tested under a combination of pressing temperature (20 °C, 55 °C, 90 °C, and 125 °C) and wood moisture content (2%, 7%, 12%, and 17%). The yield stress (σy) and modulus of elasticity (MOE) of the specimens were determined from the stress- strain response. It was found that an increase in either pressing temperature or moisture content of wood generally caused a decrease in the mechanical properties for both species. The t-test results revealed that jack pine specimens are more sensitive to changes in pressing temperature and wood moisture content than balsam poplar. For jack pine specimens, at any of the pressing temperatures, the moisture content of 12% was found to be a crucial level to start a significant decrease in σy and MOE, while at any of the moisture content, a change in temperature from 55 °C to 90 °C exhibited a significant change in σy and MOE. The regression models developed can be used to predict σy and MOE as a function of temperature and moisture content.},

This work deals with both static and creep fracture tests in opening mode crack growth under hygro-thermal and mechanical loadings. The experimental tests combining creep and hygro-thermal loadings are performed in a climatic chamber. The Double Cantilever Beam specimen with variable inertia machined in Douglas Fir and White Fir species is used to investigate the effects of these loadings on fracture processes. Two experimental protocols are presented. First, instantaneous tests are carried out in order to identify the moisture content effects on fracture properties. R-curves are studied using a finite element approach. Secondly, creep tests are performed by imposing high speed humidity variations in a climatic chamber. During these tests, the evolutions of the crack length are recorded.}}
